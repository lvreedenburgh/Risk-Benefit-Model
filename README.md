# Risk-Benefit-Model

The model in this report is made for a 10-week course on Advanced Agent based modeling at the TU Delft, in assignment for KWR. 
The objective is to find out how consumer’s and farmer’s risk and benefit perception of water reuse for irrigation develops.

IMPORTANT:
When you want to run the model via the notebook, make sure the model is in the subfolder. If it is in the same folder an infinite loop is created.
